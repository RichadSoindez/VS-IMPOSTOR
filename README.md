# Friday Night Funkin': Psych Engine

[Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine) was originally made for the [Mind Games mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/301107) with the aim to fix vanilla FNF's (circa 2021) issues, improve the casual experience, and be an easier alternative for newbie coders.

## Compiling:

Must have Haxe 4.3.4 or greater.

The setup files for Psych Engine's specific haxe libraries can be installed with the `install_haxelibs` files located in the `projFiles/setup` folder. The files are named after your operating system.

Refer to [Psych Engine's build instructions](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine/blob/main/BUILDING.md).
